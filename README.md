# WeatherDevice
This the code for a simple weather device that I created using a Raspberry Pi and the DHT Sensor included in the GrovePi sensor kit. The Sensor.py file collects data from the GrovePi temperature and humidity sensor and sends the data to the client file which then outputs the data into a json file. The data in the json file is then visualized on a dashboard using CanvasJS.
